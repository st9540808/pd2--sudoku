This a sudoku solver using backtracking algorithm with some constraint propagated optimization

how to import a question :
using a existed file with redirection
Ex: ./solve < question

question format :
0 represents a undetermined answer, every number is seperated with a whitespace
Ex:
2 0 0 8 5 9 0 0 6 
0 0 6 3 4 1 0 2 0 
0 0 9 6 7 2 5 4 0
8 5 2 0 0 4 0 1 7

output format :
an "answer type" followed by a solution(if unique)

"0" represents no solution
Ex:
0

"1" represents the question has unique solution (will print out solution)
Ex:
1
2 4 1 8 5 9 3 7 6
5 7 6 3 4 1 8 2 9
3 8 9 6 7 2 5 4 1
